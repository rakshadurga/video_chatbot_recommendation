# Video Chatbot Song Recommendation System

This project is a **Video Chatbot Song Recommendation System** built with Python (Flask for the back-end) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the front-end). It allows users to speak a music genre, and the system recommends a song based on the input using the Spotify API.

## Features
- Video stream from the user's webcam
- Voice input for music genre recognition
- Song recommendation based on the spoken genre using Spotify
- Simple web-based interface

Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask (for the back-end)
Spotipy (for Spotify API)
SpeechRecognition (for voice input)
OpenCV (for video streaming)
SQLite (optional, for storing logs)
Installation Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/video_chatbot_recommendation.git
cd video_chatbot_recommendation
Install Python dependencies:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Spotify API credentials:

Sign up at Spotify Developer Dashboard.

Create a new app and get your Client ID and Client Secret.

Replace the client_id and client_secret placeholders in app.py with your own credentials:

client_id = 'your_spotify_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_spotify_client_secret'
Run the Flask server:

After setting up everything, start the Flask application by running:

python app.py
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Access the application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the Video Chatbot Song Recommendation System.

How to Use the Application
The webcam feed will be displayed on the webpage.
Press the "Speak for Song Recommendation" button.
Speak a genre into the microphone (e.g., "rock", "pop", "jazz").
The system will recognize the spoken genre and recommend a song from Spotify based on that genre.
The recommended song, along with the artist and a link to Spotify, will be displayed on the screen.
Optional: Storing Logs with SQLite
This project supports logging user interactions with SQLite.
If you want to store logs of the genres and recommended songs, you can enable the database functionality in the app.py file. A simple table will be created automatically in database.db.
Known Issues
Speech Recognition: If the system doesn’t understand the spoken genre, try speaking clearly and avoid background noise.
Spotify API Limits: Free usage of the Spotify API has certain rate limits. If you hit the limit, the system might return empty results.
Browser Permissions: Ensure that your browser has permission to access the webcam and microphone.
Troubleshooting
Webcam Not Working:

Check that your browser has permission to access the webcam.
Ensure that your webcam is connected and functioning.
Microphone Not Working:

Check that your browser has permission to access the microphone.
Ensure your microphone is properly configured on your system.
No Song Recommendations:

Make sure your Spotify credentials are correctly set in app.py.
Check if your spoken genre is recognized by the system.
